## Introduction
Spam emails are a common nuisance and pose risks such as phishing attacks and malware distribution. This project addresses the problem by leveraging machine learning techniques to automatically classify emails as spam or non-spam. Logistic regression is employed for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Features
- Logistic Regression Model: Utilizes logistic regression for classification.
- Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from email content.
- Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of email data efficiently.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prateek0809/Spam_Mail_Detection.git
